# Project Title
Group 3 Magnificent Seven Stock Adviser

# Description
The goal of this application is to develop a ML adviser to Magnificent Seven Stock prices, noting whether the algorithm thinks the stock's price will rise or fall the following day, and suggesting to the client a relevant action - to sell if the price will fall, and to buy if the price will rise. 
Other features of the app include a home page which spells out the project to the client, as well as a number of tables and graphs for each individual stock, giving the client a chance to see the historical information the relative algorithm was built on. 

# Installation Instructions
The app is easy to set up. Please make your way to the public site "https://pygroupproject-ensx4wypmgy59rhnmzvdlr.streamlit.app/" where you will come in contact with the homepage. Please browse through the homepage to gather additional information on the companies we selected, as well as additional details regarding the structuring of our ML algorithm.
In your left menu, you'll see the option to "Choose a Stock." Navigate to this page, where you will be asked to enter your personal SimFin API key. This is to ensure API charges are sent exclusively to the client using the app. 

# Usage
This app can be used via the public link listed above, or, locally. If you'd like to guage the app locally, clone the respository, install the dependencies listed in the requirements text (pip install -r requirements.txt), and run the API.
